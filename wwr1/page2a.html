                    <h3>Yampa River Rafting</h3>
                    <p>Yampa River rafting is special because the Yampa is WILD. This is the last river in the
                         Colorado River system that is not regulated by a dam. Despite continued attempts by 
                         the Bureau of Reclamation and Congress, the only major dam ever constructed on the Yampa 
                         River was built by Mother Nature. And even that was temporary. </p>

                    <p>    On June 9th, 1965, a massive flash flood and debris flow carried thousands of tons of rock 
                        down Warm Springs Draw, completely blocking the river channel. The river slowed upstream 
                        of the obstruction, and the current snarled and boiled and pushed against the debris. It 
                        took only 24 hours for the river to breach the natural dam, leaving in its wake Warm Springs
                         Rapid, rated as one of the 10 biggest drops in the country. Dee Holladay was one of the 
                         first to run the newly formed rapid..</p>

                    <h3>Gates of Lodore</h3>
                    <p>Rafting through the Gates of Lodore is like entering an enchanted wonderland. Bighorn sheep, 
                        bears, osprey, eagles, and other wildlife roam the river banks, and history comes to life 
                        through rapids and rock art. Deep in the heart of Dinosaur National Monument, Lodore Canyon 
                        rafting trips are great for families and first-time river runners. .</p>
                    <p> Gates of Lodore rafting trips carry you over some thrilling rapids, including Disaster 
                        Falls and Hells Half Mile, as well as dozens of smaller rapids that are great fun to 
                        paddle inflatable kayaks through. Hike to secret waterfalls. swimming holes, and 
                        thousand-year-old rock art left behind by some of the canyon’s original inhabitants.</p>

                    <p> If you’re looking for a river rafting trip that has it all, but you only have a weekend 
                        to get away, look no further than our trip through Ruby and Westwater Canyons on the Colorado 
                        River! Get a little taste of everything a river trip has to offer. Spend a weekend discovering 
                        the majesty of the Colorado River in the canyon that some call a miniature Grand Canyon.</p>
