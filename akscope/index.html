                            <p>Greetings!  My name is Karis and I like to collect and use telescopes.  However, I also live 
                                in the great state of Alaska which adds a sense of adventure to the setup and use of 
                                backyard astronomy equipment.  This site is dedicated to tell you of my issues, struggles 
                                and shear happiness in looking up at the sky.  This is a test.</p>
        
                            <p> So far, this site will consist of four pages.  I hope that the content will change, as I grow 
                                and learn in this wonderful hobby of back yard star gazing.  This is a work in progress; and 
                                as in any hobby, I hope to learn new things and have great adventures in my journey to see the 
                                universe better.  So, come with me as I explore the heavens from my back yard! What follows is my 
                                journey into watching the Sun, Moon, and stars in various ways.  A learning experience, if you 
                                will, that I would like to share with you.
                                  </p>

                            <h3>Solar</h3>
                            <p>Solar astrophotography in the summer in Alaska offers a unique and exciting opportunity for 
                                astronomers and photographers alike. During the summer months, Alaska experiences long daylight 
                                hours, with the sun remaining in the sky for up to 24 hours a day in the far north. This extended 
                                daylight means that the sun's position in the sky can be captured for much longer periods compared 
                                to other regions. With the right equipment, it's possible to document and photograph solar 
                                activity, such as sunspots, solar flares, and prominences, during the entire span of daylight, 
                                giving photographers ample time to work without the time constraints of a more typical solar 
                                observing schedule.</p>

                            <p> Additionally, summer in Alaska provides a clear and crisp atmosphere, with generally less air 
                                turbulence than during other seasons. The cooler air can result in sharper images of the sun's surface 
                                details. Although the sun might be high in the sky during the peak of summer, its angle offers 
                                opportunities for interesting and dynamic compositions, especially with features like solar prominences 
                                visible on the limb of the sun. The extended daylight also allows for the possibility of capturing 
                                time-lapse sequences, showcasing how solar features evolve throughout the day. Overall, the combination 
                                of long daylight hours, stable atmospheric conditions, and Alaska's beautiful landscapes makes summer 
                                solar astrophotography an appealing and rewarding pursuit.</p>

                            <h3>Night Time</h3>
                            <p>Winter stargazing in Alaska offers a truly magical experience, especially when the long, dark nights provide 
                                ample time for observation. During the winter months, the clear, crisp air creates excellent viewing 
                                conditions, with less atmospheric distortion than in warmer seasons. The cold air can also result in 
                                sharper, more vivid images of distant stars and deep-sky objects. For those lucky enough to live in rural 
                                or remote areas of Alaska, light pollution is minimal, allowing for some of the darkest, most breathtaking 
                                skies you'll ever encounter. This is the perfect setting for stargazing, whether you're looking to observe 
                                the constellations, track planets, or capture the beauty of the Milky Way. </p>

                            <p>Additionally, the winter months offer the possibility of seeing the aurora borealisâ€”an iconic and stunning 
                                phenomenon that's best viewed during the long, dark nights. The northern lights can add an otherworldly 
                                glow to your starry sky, creating a breathtaking backdrop for astrophotography or simply for enjoying the 
                                natural beauty above. With snow-covered landscapes reflecting the celestial light, winter stargazing in 
                                Alaska feels like an immersive experience into the universe itself. Plus, the relative isolation of many 
                                Alaskan locations means you can often experience the night sky in its purest form, uninterrupted by the 
                                distractions of city life. For astronomy enthusiasts, winter offers not only incredible visual opportunities 
                                but also the chance to connect with the cosmos in a uniquely peaceful and awe-inspiring setting. </p>
