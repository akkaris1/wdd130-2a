                            <h3>Night Time Backyard Star Gazing</h3>
                            <p>Well, this is where it starts to get interesting.  There are hundreds of websites and YouTube videos that will
                                will give you great advice and ideas on where to getting started, and how to proceed doing backyard astromony.  It's much harder 
                                than going to the store, buying a telescope, setting it up in the backyard, and seeing the wonders of the universe.  Ok, maybe 
                                not THAT much harder than you think.  With all the videos on the internet, it actually can be quite simple.  First, let me throw 
                                in my advice. </p>
    
                            <p> Don't buy a telescope from Walmart.  Or any other "box store".  Not even Costco.  Go to a telescope store.  Go to a telescope website.
                                I have listed my personal favorite on the links page, but there are many others, I am sure.  Most are very helpful, and are happy 
                                to work with you and find exactly what would fit you and your budget. The one thing I have figured out about this hobby is money is a big thing. The more 
                                expensive a scope or accessory is,  the better it MAY work.  This isn't a rock hard rule; it's very possible to get great views and have
                                a great experience with not a lot of money.  It's more of a patience thing.
                            </p>
    
                            <p>First of all, I try very hard to get equipment that will have several appications, but that doesn't always work.  What I would tell a new 
                                comer is to figure out what they want to do, to look at, and go from there.  There are scopes that are designed to observe things inside our 
                                solar system: like the Maksutov-Cassegrain telescope with focal ratio like f/15.  This provides high contrast views of the planets and lunar 
                                landscapes, perfect for planetary imagers and visual observers.  But it's HEAVY.  This is a big consideration if you need to move it often.  
                                You can have the best telescope in the world, but use an under-rated or wobblily mount, and nothing will be good.  Note:  In the not too 
                                distant future, mounts will have their own page.
                                  </p>

                            <p> There are scopes that can do a little bit of everything; if everything is “local” planets and deep sky objects, like galaxies, 
                                nebulae, and star clusters.  Schmidt-Cassegrain Telescopes (SCT) are good for this.  In fact, an 8 inch SCT, which are produced by 
                                many companies such as Celestron and Sky-Watcher among others, is a common scope used for this.  I have a C8 EVO SCT, which is 
                                wonderful for both deep sky objects and looking at objects a bit closer to home.  It's a bit large, a little heavy, and contains a lot of 
                                glass.  I also have a C6 SCT, that came with my NexStar Evolution (EVO) as a package deal.  This is a great setup, as the EVO charges up at home, 
                                and then runs without external power for about 8 hours, and is an easy to use go to mount.  I love this mount, as it will accept any tube that 
                                I currently own, but has a very serious drawback that applies here in Alaska: it can't get cold, or it kills the battery.  In the future, I 
                                will be exploring ways to keep that battery warm.</p>

                            <p> I seem to have amassed a large amount of equipment.  It seems like it to me, anyway.  I will post some images below of my
