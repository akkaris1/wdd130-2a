                        <h3>Solar</h3>
                        <p>First, I feel the need to stress the importance of having the right equipment for looking at the Sun.  
                            While many people are quite capable of safely modifying and using modified solar telescopes and observation 
                            equipment, I choose to err on the side of caution.  Therefore, I obtained a telescope that is designed for 
                            safe solar observation.  I started out with a Lunt 40mm Dedicated Hydrogen-Alpha Solar scope, but found that it wasn't 
                            quite where I wanted to be, so I upgraded to the Lunt 60mm Universal.  </p>

                        <p> The Sun is the one object in the sky we don’t usually look at. </p>

                        <p>But once a person sees it, it’s hard not to look.  With a Hydrogen-Alpha scope, you only see about 0.01% of the 
                            visible light that is generated by the sun.  But it’s a magical 0.01%, and is by far the most interesting and 
                            entertaining emission line from the Sun.  The view is different every time you look.  There are events such as CMTs 
                            (Coronal Mass Ejections) and flares which are becoming more frequent. They are by far the most awe inspiring events 
                            that can be viewed thru a Solar scope in real time.  The surface seems to be a swirling mass of fire, ever changing 
                            and very dynamic as it’s flows in real time. </p>

                        <p>A Solar Telescope is a completely different animal to its cousin, the nighttime scope. A Solar Telescope is a multi-filter 
                            system that requires an engineered precision balance of aperture, etalon size and performance, f-ratio, etalon placement, 
                            safety filters, and out of band blocking. It is not a secret that the price of a Solar Systems increases dramatically 
                            based on the size of the etalon paired to the system.  Nighttime scopes are light buckets. They are being used to 
                            try and resolve faint and distant objects. The larger the aperture you can utilize given the seeing conditions, the 
                            more detail you can resolve on faint objects.
                            </p>

                        <h3>My Solar Equipment</h3>
                        <p>  This is my Lunt 60mm Universal Telescope. This is the smallest scope in Lunts line of Universal scopes, and is capable 
                            of both solar and nighttime veiwing, I most likely will use it only for solar.  It has the Hydrogen Alpha blocking filter
                            B600, which is a 2" diagonal.  It has a Rack and Pinon focuser.  Someday, I plan to upgrade this scope with a Lunt LS 60FHa 
                            Double stack unit, which will just make already wonderful views even better.The focal ratio is f/7 at a focal lengh of 420mm.  It is 
                            usually mounted on my Celestron Advanced VX mount, which is the lighter of my two main EQ mounts (I also have a Sky-Watcher 
                            EQ6-R Pro, which tends to be more stable, but way heavier). This image was taken with an ZWO ASI174mm Planetary camera, and 
                            processed with Astropixel software. I purchased both Lunt scopes through Mike at OC Telescopes.  I have a link to them on the "links" page.
